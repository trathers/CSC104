    <h2> Business Intelligence Dashboard Development </h2>
    <p> I specialize in building dynamic Business Intelligence (BI) dashboards that transform raw data into clear, actionable insights. My approach bridges technical precision with strategic decision-making—integrating data from multiple systems, automating performance tracking, and visualizing KPIs that directly impact profitability, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. A well-built dashboard doesn’t just report data—it tells a story. It empowers leadership to spot trends, identify risks early, and make informed, data-driven decisions in real time. By streamlining complex datasets into intuitive visuals, I help organizations move beyond guesswork and operate with clarity, confidence, and measurable results.</p>

    <h2> What That Means in Practice</h2>

<p>Faster sales cycles (e.g., 25% faster) mean sooner revenue recognition, less time spent in deals, and more deals closed in a given period. Higher win-rates (e.g., +10-15%) translate directly into more revenue for same input (pipeline, leads).When marketing/lead-gen ROI improves 25%, that means for every dollar spent you get more dollars back — indirectly boosting revenue or profitability.
The general benefits of BI (better data access, fewer errors, quicker decisions) reduce waste, improve focus on high-value opportunities, and free up resources to drive growth rather than firefight. </p>

    <h2> Shopify API Modernization: Migrating to GraphQL for Smarter Commerce</h2>
    <p> I led the transition from legacy Shopify REST APIs to the modern GraphQL API framework, streamlining how data is queried and delivered across storefront, order, and fulfillment systems. This upgrade reduced redundant calls, optimized payload efficiency, and improved response times by enabling clients to retrieve only the data they actually need. </p>

    <h2> What does this mean for Business? </h2>
    <p> From a business standpoint, this transformation means faster page loads, smoother checkout experiences, and lower operational costs tied to API overuse and server lag. By adopting GraphQL, I positioned the platform for scalability—supporting advanced analytics, personalized customer journeys, and real-time inventory visibility that directly enhance conversion rates, customer satisfaction, and overall revenue performance.</p>

    <h2> Operating Model Revamp: Implementing a Target Operating Model (TOM) for Scalable Growth</h2>
    <p> I redesigned the company’s operating model using a Target Operating Model (TOM) framework to align people, processes, technology, and governance with the organization’s long-term strategy. This involved mapping current-state inefficiencies, defining future-state capabilities, and implementing streamlined workflows that improved accountability and decision-making across teams. The TOM provided a clear blueprint for how the business should function end-to-end—clarifying roles, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring technology investments directly supported strategic goals.</p>

     <h2> Is your Operating Model Costing you money? </h2>
     <p> For businesses, a well-structured TOM is critical because it transforms fragmented operations into a unified, efficient system—reducing costs, improving agility, and enabling sustainable growth in rapidly changing markets. Intentional TOM saves money because it replaces reactive operations with predictable, scalable, and measurable systems. In financial terms, mature organizations implementing TOMs often see 10–30% reductions in operating costs within the first year, along with improved productivity and strategic focus.</p>

    <h2> LTL Transportation Integration: Optimizing Freight Operations with Oracle Transportation Management (OTM)</h2>
    <p> I led the integration of LTL carrier networks into Oracle Transportation Management (OTM), enabling real-time visibility, automated rating, and streamlined shipment execution across multiple distribution centers. This project replaced manual scheduling and disconnected carrier portals with a unified logistics platform—reducing tendering time, improving on-time delivery rates, and cutting freight costs through better mode and carrier optimization. By connecting APIs between OTM, warehouse systems, and carrier EDI feeds, I helped the business gain end-to-end shipment intelligence—tracking costs, service levels, and exceptions from a single dashboard. For companies managing complex freight volumes, this level of integration matters because it translates directly into lower transportation spend, fewer service failures, and stronger customer satisfaction through predictable, data-driven delivery performance.</p>

    <H2> Why Businesses Should Invest in LTL OTM Integration </H2>
    <p> nvesting in an integrated LTL solution through Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) is not just a logistics upgrade—it’s a strategic investment in efficiency, transparency, and profitability. Most businesses waste money due to fragmented shipping processes, manual rate comparisons, and poor visibility into carrier performance. An OTM-based LTL integration automates these pain points—consolidating shipments, comparing real-time carrier rates, and automatically selecting the most cost-effective routes. This reduces freight spend by 10–20% on average while improving on-time delivery and customer satisfaction.Beyond cost savings, OTM gives leadership the analytics to forecast demand, negotiate stronger carrier contracts, and respond faster to supply chain disruptions. It turns transportation from a back-office cost center into a data-driven value driver. In short, investing in this solution helps companies scale operations, control margins, and deliver consistently—essential advantages in competitive logistics environments.</p>
