    <p> As you can see, I am learning how to code via HTML. There are so many things I have learned in this course so far such as, how to make this my paragraph and making <b> TEXT BOLD</b> to emphasize important points. <i> If you are really intrigued by what I am doing, I have made this sentence italicized just to show off a bit of my skills.</i> </p> 

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color:red"> Introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
    <p> As you can start to see, I have changed the heading's font and color. I've done this by inlining the code for this action. Seems cool right? Well <b> YEAH!</b> until you have a project that requires you to change all the font and color of a webpage due to "re-branding", now this cool feature has become a coding logistical nightmare! This is where Cascading Style Sheets better known as CSS gets it shine!</p>

    <p> CSS help turns a dull and plan webapge like this:</p>

    <h4 style="color:blueviolet; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> BEFORE CSS </h4>

<h4 style="color:blueviolet; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> AFTER CSS </h4>
